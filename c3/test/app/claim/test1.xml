                Do you agree to us getting information from any current or previous employer you have told us about as part of this claim? Yes


                Do you agree to us getting information from any other person or organisation you have told us about as part of this claim? Yes


                This is my claim for Carer's Allowance.
                I understand that if I am paid Carer's Allowance it may affect the benefits paid to Test Middle CaseThree.
                If the person you are caring for receives certain benefits, the amount they receive may be affected by your claim for Carer's Allowance. Because of this we need both of you to understand the potential consequences of your claim to Carer's Allowance.
                If Test Middle CaseThree gets a Severe Disability Premium with their income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, Income Support, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Housing Benefit, they may no longer get that premium if we pay Carer's Allowance to you.
                If Test Middle CaseThree's Pension Credit includes an extra amount for severe disability, they may no longer get that extra amount if we pay Carer's Allowance to you.
                This could also affect any reduction in Council Tax Test Middle CaseThree may be entitled to. To find out more about it, please contact the Local Authority.
                We will need to check Test Middle CaseThree entitlement to Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payment, Attendance Allowance, Constant Attendance Allowance or Armed Forces Independence Payment when considering your claim.
                We may contact Test Middle CaseThree or their representative to establish whether 35 hours caring per week is taking place.

                Please tick this box to declare that you have understood the notes and you have made / will make the person you are caring for / or their representative aware that there could be a change to their benefits. = yes

                I declare that I understand the Carer's Allowance Claim Notes and that the information provided on this claim form is correct and complete.
                I understand that I must report all changes in my circumstances or that of the person that I am caring for which may affect my entitlement promptly and by failing to do so I may be liable to prosecution or face a financial penalty.
                I will phone 08456084321 or write to Carer's Allowance Unit, Palatine House, Preston, Lancaster, PR1 1HB to report a change in my circumstances or that of the person that I am caring for.
                If I give false or incomplete information or fail to report changes in my circumstances or that of the person that I am caring for promptly, I understand that my Carer's Allowance may be stopped or reduced and any overpayment of Carer's Allowance may be recovered. In addition I may be prosecuted or face a financial penalty.
                We may wish to contact any current or previous employers, or other persons or organisations you have listed on this claim form to obtain information about your claim. You do not have to agree to this but if you do not, it may mean that we are unable to obtain enough information to satisfy ourselves that you meet the conditions of entitlement for your claim.

                Please tick this box to confirm that you understand and make the declarations above. = yes
                Please tick this box if this claim form has been filled in by someone else, if so, please ensure that you understand the declarations above as another person cannot make the declarations on your behalf. = yes
