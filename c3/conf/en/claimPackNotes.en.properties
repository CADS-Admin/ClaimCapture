claimNotes.section1.1=What is Carer''s Allowance?
claimNotes.section1.2=Carer''s Allowance is a benefit to help people who care for a disabled person for 35 hours or more each week. The person you care for must be in receipt of a qualifying benefit. These are :
claimNotes.section1.3=* Personal Independence Payment at either rate of the Daily Living Component
claimNotes.section1.4=* Disability Living Allowance at the **middle or highest rate of the care component**, or
claimNotes.section1.5=* Attendance Allowance, or
claimNotes.section1.6=* Constant Attendance Allowance at or above the **normal maximum rate with Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit**, or at or above **the basic full-day rate with a War Disablement Pension**
claimNotes.section1.7=* Armed Forces Independence Payment
claimNotes.section1.8=If the person you care for is getting one of these benefits, they will have a letter telling them what rate they are getting.
claimNotes.section1.9=**Carer''s Allowance is paid to the person who does the caring - not the person being cared for.**
claimNotes.section1.10=You may have to pay tax on your Carer''s Allowance.
claimNotes.section1.11=To find out the current weekly rate of Carer''s Allowance, go to
claimNotes.section1.12=[www.gov.uk/carers-allowance](https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance) or ask for a leaflet about benefit rates.
claimNotes.section1.13=Carer''s Allowance does not depend on :
claimNotes.section1.14=* the level of your savings, or
claimNotes.section1.15=* if you have paid any National Insurance (NI) contributions.

claimNotes.section1.18=* Income Support
claimNotes.section1.19=* Employment and Support Allowance
claimNotes.section1.20=* Pension Credit
claimNotes.section1.21=Housing Benefit
claimNotes.section1.22=This extra money is called *severe disability premium or the addition for severe disability*.
claimNotes.section1.23=If you are paid Carer''s Allowance for looking after them, this extra money will stop. The person you are looking after cannot get severe disability premium if you are getting Carer''s Allowance.
claimNotes.section1.24=This could also affect any reduction in Council Tax they may be entitled to. To find out more about it, please contact the Local Authority.
claimNotes.section1.25=If you have only underlying entitlement to Carer''s Allowance and are not actually paid it, the person you look after will still get any extra money they are entitled to.
claimNotes.section1.26=Underlying entitlement means you are entitled to Carer''s Allowance but it is not paid because you get another benefit or entitlement that is as much as or more than Carer''s Allowance.

claimNotes.section12.13=**If someone else is also looking after the same person**
claimNotes.section12.14=If someone else is also looking after the same person as you are, only one of you can get Carer''s Allowance. Two people cannot get Carer''s Allowance at the same time for looking after the same person. You must decide between you who is going to claim it.

claimNotes.section13.2=National Insurance credits for carers of working age can automatically protect your future entitlement to the basic elements of the State Pension and Bereavement Benefits when Carer''s Allowance is not being paid for any reason.

claimNotes.section13.4=* Before your Carer''s Allowance entitlement begins
claimNotes.section13.5=* During any breaks from care
claimNotes.section13.6=* At the end of any period of Carer''s Allowance entitlement
claimNotes.section13.7=If you are a married woman paying reduced rate NI contributions, we cannot give you Class 1 NI contribution credits for each week you are paid Carer''s Allowance.
